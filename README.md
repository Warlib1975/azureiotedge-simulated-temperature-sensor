# Azure IoT Edge simulated temperature and humidity sensor
IoT Edge module originaally developed by Microsoft as a sample. The project located here: https://github.com/Azure/iot-edge-v1/tree/master/v2/samples/azureiotedge-simulated-temperature-sensor Now, the sources are moved somewhere, so 404 error occurred when going to the URI. 
It's not so easy to build module from the Microsoft source. You need to change some files. Here is adapted version of the sources to simplify the module building.
Some description available in Russian at the page http://www.bizkit.ru/2018/11/12/5737/
