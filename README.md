# Azure IoT Edge simulated temperature and humidity sensor
IoT Edge module originally were developed by Microsoft as a IoT Edge module sample (C#). The project was located here: https://github.com/Azure/iot-edge-v1/tree/master/v2/samples/azureiotedge-simulated-temperature-sensor Now, the sources are moved somewhere, so 404 error occurred when going to the URI. 
It's not so easy to build module from the Microsoft sources. You need to change some files. Here is adapted version of the sources to simplify the simple module building.
